## About the project

For this project, it was designed a front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails. The main goal was to use **JavaScript** to create a **Single Page Application** through manipulations in the **DOM**.

## Credits

This is one of six projects proposed in CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript, a computer science course taught at Harvard University. Some of the code had already been written, in advance, for the students by the course staff team.
